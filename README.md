# 50 Project in 50 days

## Why do this challenge?

I want to sharpen my skills as a frontend developer and also show prospective employers that I can work on the frontend.
The best way to do that is by showing them samples of code and building projects, that is why I created this repository.
currently these projects are not mobile responsive and a best viewed on larger screens.

## The Projects

### Day One - Expanding Cards
